    Something with slightly broader coverage to start with. The Surrey
    Wildlife Trust has been producing a wonderful
    series of "Wildlife Atlases" over the last years. They have been extremely
    well received and provide valuable coverage
    of Surrey's wildlife. Being atlases, of course they contain distribution maps
    of the various species they cover. So they
    help enormously in finding out in detail what is present in Mole Valley.
    Buy them while you can. Follow this link to

    As with all things, you will learn about Mole Valley's wildlife most

      Juniper Hall</a>,
    a local centre run by the
    Field Studies Council, has an excellent supply of intelligent friends. They
